    Yoo! My name is Alain and this is my project blog where I attempt to document
    progress for games and websites of my own creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Visit my collection to see my past <a href="#">game</a> projects and
    <a href="#">website</a> projects. I also produce as well so feel free to
    stop by my <a href="#">beats page</a> for tracks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Check out the <a href="#">blog page</a> to see
    updates about my life and most recent progress for my current projects.
    If you'd like to get into contact with me,
    feel free to visit my <a href="/contact.html">contacts</a> page.
  </p>
   <p>
     Feel free to try out some of my games!
