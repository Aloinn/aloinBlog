I Recently started learning JS to replace GML. There are many many similarities
between the two languages which made picking up JavaScript really easy.
GML is too limitted as a language, being only usable in Gamemaker Studio.
Here's my first JavaScript project, PONG.</p>
<canvas id="myCanvas" width ="500" height="500">
</canvas><p>
<script src="/pong.js"></script>
<em>Play my version of pong!</em>


<div class="news-heading">
  <h2>Controls</h2>
</div>
<p>
<b>Left arrow:</b> Move left</br>
<b>Right arrow:</b> Move right</br>
<b>Shift:</b> New game</br>

</p>

  <h2>AI Explained</h2>
</div>
<p>
How the AI for my version of pong works is that I measure
the cycles it will take before the ball reaches the other paddle.
Afterwards, the # of cycles is used to calculate how much horizontal distance the
ball will cover in total.
</br></br>
<b>If the ball's horizontal speed + ball's x coorinate is still in canvas</b>
</br>
The AI paddle will go to the position of horizontal speed + ball's x coordinate
</br></br>
<b>OTHERWISE</b>
</br>
If the ball is going to bounce off a wall. The horizontal distance is divided by canvas width.
</br></br>
<b>If the floored value is EVEN, (Will bounce off walls odd number of times)</b></br>
it will meet the AI at a distance from the side the ball is currently moving away from
</br></br>
<b>If the floored value is ODD, (Will bounce off walls even number of times</b></br>
it will meet the AI at a distance from the side the ball is currently moving towards
</br></br>
The said distance is the remainder after dividing the total distance travelled by the canvas width.
</br></p>
