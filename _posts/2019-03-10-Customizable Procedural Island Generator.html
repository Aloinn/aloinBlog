This is an expansion on the previous idea of procedural island generation,

<p>
For this idea of procedural generation, there are customizable probability properties.
Depending on the adjacent tiles of a candidate position,
the probability of the tile actually getting placed may vary.
</p>
<p>
Side note: The beige color tiles are sand tiles that get added upon finalization.
They do not represent the candidate positions. I really like them because they
help establish that 'island' vibe

  <em>Two examples of procedurally generated islands with probability</em>

<p>
In this version of my procedural generation project, the chance of a candidate position
becoming a land tile is determined by it's surrounding tiles. Land tiles and candidate position
tiles are both considered as neighbours.
</p>
<p>
  Below is a diagram that represents a candidate position and it's adjacent tiles. White
  squares represent <b>free spaces</b> to the candidate. Black squares represent
  <b>neighbouring squares</b> to the candidate
</p>

  <em>
    from left to right: 'one sided' piece, 'corner' piece, 'line' piece, 'crevice' piece
  </em>
<p>
  If a candidate position has one side where it meets a neightbour, and three sides where it
  does not meet neither a land tile nor a candidate position tile, it is considered to be a 'one side' piece.<b> Refer image 1</b>
</p>
<p>
  If a candidate position has two sides where it meets a neightbour, it may fall under one of two categories,
  either a 'line' piece or 'corner' piece.
</p>
<p>
  A piece is a corner piece when the neighbours are on adjacent sides
  of the candidate. <b> Refer image 2</b>
</p>
<p>
  A piece is a line piece when the neighbours are on opposite sides
  of the candidate. <b> Refer image 3</b>
</p>
<p>
  A piece is a crevice piece when there are three neighbours and one free side.
  <b> Refer image 4</b>
</p>
<p>
  The probability manipulation of each type of candidate peace results in different types of islands
  For example, if there is a low probability of 'one sided' pieces converting to land tiles, this will
  result in minimal protruding land pieces, low amounts of <b>peninsulas</b>.

<p>
Controls:</br></br>
Left click: Run a round of tile generation</br>
Right click: Fix unchosen candidates inside island</br>
Space bar: Reset generation</br>
Scroll in/out: Zoom in/out</br>
</p>
<p>
The first number on the top corner indicates whether a click is registered or not</br>
The second number on the top corner indicates the amount of possible candidates for land tiles to generate on.

<p>
  You can see that after a number or rounds, the island may grow
  fairly large. It still retains the natural landmass vibe however!
