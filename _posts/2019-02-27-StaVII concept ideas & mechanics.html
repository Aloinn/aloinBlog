The idea for the mechanics of StaVII is pretty simple. It was
inspired by my love for the thrill of fast pace decision making games
and tile-based strategy games. I think the mechanics are pretty unique
and can be further expanded on to make derivatives for future ideas.

How the game works is that the AI places ships on their side of the
10x10 grid board. You must place ships on your side of the 10x10
grid board to counter their placement. Your goal is to stop their ships
from crossing to your side while placing ships that can cross to their side.
There are different tiers of ships you can use each with unique attacking points
and blind spots. Will drop prototype in the upcoming week. School is really hectic
this week!
